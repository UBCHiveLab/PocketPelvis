test: 
- model recognition is unstable, so we have to come up with another way of recognition. 
- took an existing printed pelvis (blue) and glued 3 QR code images generated online to here.
- AR object placement on real model was inaccurate because image target is glued onto curved surface (needs flat).
- however, found that it worked well enough to experiment more on.

test2:
- mehrdad's working on holocube with detachable faces, so we tried incorporating that idea into pocketpelvis.
- addressed problems in test by making a flat-faced, form fitting chip to glued image target onto.
- only that wing of the pelvis was printed (black), as well as a form fitting chip attached to pelvis wing by magnets (black).
- recognition and accuracy of AR object placement on real model were good.

test3:
- expanded test2 concept to full pelvis.
- 1 pelvis (clear) with 6 magnetic, form fitting, numbered image targets (black).
- found that human error in gluing image target to chip, and gluing magnet to chip and pelvis cause significant inaccuracy (offset) in AR object placement.
- also, QR code don't offer enough tracking points. 
- for aesthetic, pelvis size is too small for 2x2cm target.
- this problem not detected in test2 because only the wing was printed so the amount of deflection given the same angle offset was less.

test3multitarget:
- tried with multitarget in vuforia.
- didn't work due to multitarget's need for precise location relations between targets.

test4:
- printed new pelvis (clear) to address problems in test3.
- embed flat surfaces onto pelvis instead of making them detachable to reduce human error in gluing down magnets.
- changed from QR codes to recommended images from vuforia's website. lost numbering, but recognition is better.
- increased pelvis size to 1.6 times original, because 2x2cm image target fit perfectly on vertibrate at 1.6 scale.
- implemented a code to better transition better image targets, as well as give user response in form of text on screen.
- still has problems of inaccuracy, although problems not significant in the image targets closer to the center of the pelvis.
- tried rescale reference pelvis of each image target individually to compensate for some size inaccuracy.

test4_sameScale:
- rescaled all reference pelvis by the same scale. 

test5:
- tried multitarget, with an external cube.
- multitarget's chances of recognition is much less than single target, and size offset is a problem as well.
- AR object placement is much less jittery than multiple single targets though.

decisionmaking:
- compiled these tests and tried different variations for claudia to make a decision.
- we recommend H, and that was selected.
- also, concluded to implement both model recogition and image recognition to add robustness.

test6: 
- in the meeting, being able to put model in anatomical position is very helpful, so it's implemented here.
