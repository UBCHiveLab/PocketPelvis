since pelvis is older version, it's smaller and cant be changed because of how scaling works in blender, it'll screw up ishan's muscle positions

we'll do it this way:
- when making parts in inventor, etc. make it 1.0 scale
- when import to blender, use 1.0/1.6 scale
- when export whole thing as fbx, use 1.6 scale
